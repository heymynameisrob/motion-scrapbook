# Motion Scrapbook

A repository of small UI instances that experiment with motion and interaction. These are collections of things I've learnt over the past few years.

## Why?
Last year I set myself a task to get better at animation. I wanted to understand the principles of what makes a good animation (more below). To do that I started to experiment with building motion into UI bits that I've worked on. Also I've looked at some killer designers on the web and copied what they were doing.

## Project structure
A simple React + Vite app with Tailwind 4 and a few other bits. Everything important is stored in `/src`.
- **/components**: Specific components and motion examples. This is the stuff you're looking for.
- **/primitives**: Basic UI components. Typically wrappers around Radix UI.
- **/lib**: Other bits

## Motion best practices (WIP)

### Performance
- Most animations can be handled by CSS rather than JavaScript. This reduces bundle-size, complexity, and improves performance in most cases.
- Animation libraries like Motion or `react-spring` take care of lots of basics for you. Use them when you can.
- Looping animations should pause when not visible on the screen to offload CPU and GPU usage
- Switching themes should not trigger transitions and animations on elements.
- Use `scroll-behavior: smooth` for navigating to in-page anchors, with an appropriate offset
- Animate composite properties like `transform` and `opacity` over layout or paint properties (e.g. `height` or `width`) [^1]
- Animations should run at ~60fps to feel fluid and smooth
- Use `will-change:transform|opacity...` or `transform: translateZ(0)` on heavy animations [^2]

### Accessibility
- Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Bonus points for offering using control to toggle this on/off.
- If users prefers reduced motion, don't autoplay videos
- When mounting elements to the DOM with animation, provide a screen-reader alternative that is always there but hidden to visual users
- User aria labels `aria-hidden` to hide elements that are just for animated purposes (e.g. loaders)
- Pause looping animations on keyboard focus [^3]

### Design
- Think about motion as if the elements were physical objects. Respect origin, gravity etc.
- Spring-based animations make animations feels higher-polished but can be distracting if too much
- Use motion sparingly. Actions that are frequent and low in novelty should avoid extraneous animations:
    - Opening a right click menu
    - Deleting or adding items from a list
    - Hovering trivial buttons
- Animation values should be proportional to the trigger size:
    - Don't animate dialog scale in from 0 â†’ 1, fade opacity and scale from ~0.8
    - Don't scale buttons on press from 1 â†’ 0.8, but ~0.96, ~0.9, or so
    - Duration for animating a sidebar should be smaller than moving an entire page around
- If in doubt, go with `200ms` and `easOut` to make animations look ðŸ‘Œ
- Most built-in easing curves suck. I use the ones below:

```css
:root {
  --ease-in: cubic-bezier(0.55, 0.055, 0.675, 0.19);

  --ease-in-quad: cubic-bezier(0.55, 0.085, 0.68, 0.53);
  --ease-in-quart: cubic-bezier(0.895, 0.03, 0.685, 0.22);
  --ease-in-quint: cubic-bezier(0.755, 0.05, 0.855, 0.06);
  --ease-in-expo: cubic-bezier(0.95, 0.05, 0.795, 0.035);
  --ease-in-circ: cubic-bezier(0.6, 0.04, 0.98, 0.335);

  --ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.215, 0.61, 0.355, 1);
  --ease-out-quad: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94);
  --ease-out-quart: cubic-bezier(0.165, 0.84, 0.44, 1);
  --ease-out-quint: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);
  --ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1);
  --ease-out-circ: cubic-bezier(0.075, 0.82, 0.165, 1);

  --ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.645, 0.045, 0.355, 1);
  --ease-in-out-quad: cubic-bezier(0.455, 0.03, 0.515, 0.955);
  --ease-in-out-quart: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1);
  --ease-in-out-quint: cubic-bezier(0.86, 0, 0.07, 1);
  --ease-in-out-expo: cubic-bezier(1, 0, 0, 1);
  --ease-in-out-circ: cubic-bezier(0.785, 0.135, 0.15, 0.86);
}
```

[^2] Don't apply globally or use willy-nilly. Apply `will-change` to frequent animations and `transform: translateZ(0)` to boost performance if sluggish.
